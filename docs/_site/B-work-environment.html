  <h2>Work environment</h2>
  <time datetime="2020-07-26T00:00:00+00:00" class="by-line">26 Jul 2020</time>
  <p>As with most projects, one of the first steps to take is to set up a working environment, since I want to read and take notes on some books and other PDF documents I’ll try “I Librarian”. Being an open-source software it’s possible to set it up on any Linux server, it doesn’t seem that it takes a lot of resources either, so an f1-micro VM (Free!) on Google Cloud Platform should be enough to host it.</p>

<p>Using a Debian as the base system, installing I Librarian was pretty straightforward, only thing is that such setup is designed to serve by default at 127.0.0.1, it was necessary accessing it using a tunneling port 80 from my computer:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">sudo </span>ssh <span class="nt">-L</span> 80:localhost:80 <span class="nt">-i</span> ~/.ssh/gcp-lzrdc lzrd@34.72.155.167
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Also “my” computer is another cloud instance, also free, but in Amazon (AMI 2 with Mate accessible via VNC)</p>

<p>Why this last Amazon VM?… it’s a long story, including a chapter where my only available hardware is a very old HP Semptron 32 bits laptop with no hard drive that miraculously works perfectly if you only run a VNC client, it’s funny if you consider COVID-19 lockdown, but I guess you had to be there.</p>

<p>Since yet another VM on AWS is serving as my “processing” unit to run python NLP and text-processing code, the need arises to connect to this headless server, ssh from my “Desktop UI” instance works great with MidnightCommander (mc) along with Micro (text editor) giving me a very easy and confortable way to browse folders and edit files using only the terminal end even with mouse integration.</p>

<h1 id="update"><a href="#header-5"></a>UPDATE:</h1>

<p>Later I realized that a simple flag on Google VM Instance and a change in the configuration of the virtual service config file allows me to use I Librarian directly pointing to the VM public IP; which is cool because I can now read the PDFs from my phone. Also I librarian seems to have some kind of AI plugin that I need to check later.</p>

<h1 id="note"><a href="#header-5"></a>NOTE:</h1>

<p>Since English is not my first language (which could be obvious by now), I’m using the help of Grammarly to help me while writing these posts.</p>
