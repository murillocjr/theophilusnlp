I"Œ	<p>The next question to solve would be: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">How similar are two documents?</code>, ideally this would be a numeric value based on the gensim-topics we can now obtain from each document.</p>

<p>Fortunately, gensim models do provide a neat function to obtain just that; this <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">diff</code> function compares topics between two models and returns a value from 0 to 1 that represents how similar is a topic to another topic.</p>

<p>Since our current code obtains 20 topics from each document we can obtain a 20x20 matrix of values comparing all topics between two models, a jupyter notebook is included in the source code that computes this matrix for any required model and even builds a graphic representation of it.</p>

<p>As a first step, we will obtain a comparison of a model to itself, this will compare all 20 topics among them and will give us an answer to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">How different are the topics obtained from this document?</code>. This way we can know if a document is mono-thematic or if it covers a wide variety of topics.</p>

<p>For example, in the following graphic we can see that the diagonal is red (indicating a distance of 0; this is, each topic is identical to itself) and for the most part, the cells are light blue without many deep blue cells (which would mean a distance of 1; indicating different topics). So we might conclude that in this document the topics are not much distant from each other</p>

<p>In this other document, we can see a lot of deep blue cells, which we can see as an indication that there are several topics not related at all among them; thus we can say that this document covers a wide variety of ‚Äúdistant‚Äù topics</p>

<p>And this last graphic shows the comparison between two models.</p>
