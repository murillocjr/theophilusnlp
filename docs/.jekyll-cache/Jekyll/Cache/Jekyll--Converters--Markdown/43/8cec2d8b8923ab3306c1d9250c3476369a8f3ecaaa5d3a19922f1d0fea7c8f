<p>Again, an independent Linux server seems ideal to handle all the NLP processes related to the implementation of the code of “Theophilus” (that’s the code-name for this little project of mine).

<p>Once more, all installation goes without a cinch, amazon VM internet connection speed is better than my local one.</p>

<p>The first thing to try is Tokenizing; according to the documentation, NLTK implements WordNet which will help us with:</p>

</ul>

<p>Installing NLTK’s “all data” as suggested:</p>
