<p>Looks promising, it goes along with my idea of a practical application and example with theoretical support, good references, and example cases; cool!</p>

<p>Based on computer science and linguistics is particularly focused on probabilistic topic modeling</p>

<p>Leximancer seems to implement a similar idea, might check it more later to see how they do it</p>

<p>A sufficiently large data set (n &gt; 1,000) will be needed.</p>

<p>Note that an extensive preprocessing phase is necessary before one can statistically analyze data through topic models.</p>

<p>Low-level natural language processing (NLP) steps will be implemented, such as:</p>

<h6 id="tokenization"><a href="#header-5"></a>tokenization</h6>
<p>Splitting up documents into sentences and sentences into words; n-gram creation: creating n consecutive words: 1-grams include, for example, “fast”, “food”, or “chain”; 2-grams concatenate two 1-grams, such as “fast food”; and 3-grams comprise three 1-grams, such as “fast food chain”</p>

<h6 id="stopping"><a href="#header-5"></a>stopping</h6>
<p>Removing common or uninformative words), partof-speech filtering (i.e., identifying and filtering words by their part of speech</p>

<h6 id="lemmatizing"><a href="#header-5"></a>lemmatizing</h6>
<p>Reducing a word into its dictionary form; for example, plural to singular for nouns, verbs to the simple present tense</p>

<h6 id="stemming"><a href="#header-5"></a>stemming</h6>
<p>Reducing a word to its stem</p>

<p>Ok, halfway through the document and the practical part starts, so hands on!</p>

<p>Minemytext was the tool used on this publication, this online tool seems pretty neat. Since I want a more hands-on code kind of approach I’ll try some toolkits:</p>
