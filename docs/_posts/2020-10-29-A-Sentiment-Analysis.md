I want to start by looking into what kind of labeled data is publicly available for this task:

* Google's AutoML for NLP Example uses 'happiness.csv', which is a simple csv with [phrase],[sentiment] lines. Where [sentiment] includes: affection, exercise, bonding, leisure, achievement, etc. Which seems interesting.
* There are public labeled twits databases whith only 3 sentiments: positive, negative and neither.

There's also this page which lists some datasets: [10 Popular Datasets For Sentiment Analysis](https://analyticsindiamag.com/10-popular-datasets-for-sentiment-analysis/). Where we can find Movies Review Datasets, Product/Commercial reviews datasets, Cars & Hotels reviews, Lexicoder with Positive/Negative Words, Computer Paper Reviews, Twitter comments, 
*
