Let's see what previous work is available on this idea, the purpose of this project is mainly to learn about NLP through a hands-on approach and gain insight on the theoretical foundations; engineering and scientific curiosity will be pursued alternatively.

Wikipedia seems to be a nice starting point:   
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topic_model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topic_model)  
- AI to classify AI: [The AI Tree](http://home.cse.ust.hk/~lzhang/topic/ai-tree.pdf). 

From there, here's a first list of documents that should provide a general idea about NLP Topic Modeling and what can be accomplished:

1.   **Applied Text Analysis with Python - Enabling Language-Aware Data Products with Machine Learning** - Benjamin Bengfort, Rebecca Bilbro, and Tony Ojeda
1.   **Text Analytics with Python A Practical Real-World Approach to Gaining Actionable Insights from Your Data** - Dipanjan Sarkar
1.   **NATURAL LANGUAGE SUMMARIZATION OF TEXT AND VIDEOS USING TOPIC MODELS** - Pradipto Das
1.   **Generalized Probabilistic Topic and Syntax Models for Natural Language Processing** - William Michael Darling
1.   **Interactive topic modeling** - Yuening Hu · Jordan Boyd-Graber · Brianna Satinoff · Alison Smith
1.   **Text Mining For Information Systems Researchers: An Annotated Topic Modeling Tutorial** Stefan Debortoli University of Liechtenstein, stefan.debortoli@uni.li Oliver Müller IT University of Copenhagen Iris Junglas Florida State University Jan vom Brocke University of Liechtenstein
